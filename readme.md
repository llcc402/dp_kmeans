# The infinite kmeans

This repo shows how Dirichlet Process based mixture of Gaussians solve the clustering problem of two rings. The advantage is that we do not need to specify the number of clusters.

## Functions included

1. data_generate: Generate two rings.

2. dp_kmeans: It is an infinite mixture of Gaussians.

## Scripts included

1. main: An example of the repo.

## Figures included

1. data: The scatter plot of the observations.

2. post: The result of the clustering.
